# Christmas-in-the-Park

[Christmas in the Park](https://github.com/Architecty/Christmas-in-the-Park) is a project created for [Steinberg Architect's](http://www.steinberg.us.com/) sponsored Christmas tree in the annual [San Jose Christmas in the Park](https://www.christmasinthepark.com/) celebration. The intent was to make our tree extra interesting, by letting anyone with a smart phone control the colors and the patterns on the tree. 

This project was initially inspired by [](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Christmas-Tree-Light-Show/), though after we decided we wanted to change colors, not just patterns, we swapped to a completely different architecture, running low energy LED strands instead of full power outlets.
